In this assignment, incompressible and isothermal RANS simulations of the high-speed leg of the Virginia Tech Stability Wind Tunnel will be carried out using the commercial ANSYS Fluent software. The wind tunnel is described and preliminary simulation results are shown in the study of (M. Sz≈ëke, 2020). The wind tunnel circuit and the section of interest is depicted in Figure 1. The purpose of the investigations is to quantify the impact of different turbulence models and inlet boundary conditions on the flow field in the test section. In order to gain meaningful insights, experimentally realisable flow conditions must be used for the computations.

Tasks
During this assignment, a personalised simulation scenario is allocated to everyone (see pers. parameters). The personalised flow conditions are summarised in Table 1 accompanied by Table 2 where further details are provided. Meshes can be downloaded from here. WARNING: meshes were created in inches!
