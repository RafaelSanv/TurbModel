Figure 1:  Schematic of the wind tunnel circuit and the section of interest including the test section. In this closed-circuit tunnel, air flow is driven by a fan placed in the low-speed leg of the tunnel. From the fan, air flows towards the settling chamber through two turning vanes. In the settling chamber, air passes through a porous screen to weaken secondary currents and the associated asymmetric flow field caused by the turning vanes. Thereafter, air rushes through a converging section to arrive to the test section where laminar-turbulent transition is triggered by a step. The section of interest includes part of the settling chamber and the entirety of the test section with an extruded region before the outlet replacing the diffuser.

In this assignment, incompressible and isothermal RANS simulations of the high-speed leg of the Virginia Tech Stability Wind Tunnel will be carried out using the commercial ANSYS Fluent software. The wind tunnel is described and preliminary simulation results are shown in the study of (M. Szőke, 2020). The wind tunnel circuit and the section of interest is depicted in Figure 1. The purpose of the investigations is to quantify the impact of different turbulence models and inlet boundary conditions on the flow field in the test section. In order to gain meaningful insights, experimentally realisable flow conditions must be used for the computations.

Tasks
During this assignment, a personalised simulation scenario is allocated to everyone (see pers. parameters). The personalised flow conditions are summarised in Table 1 accompanied by Table 2 where further details are provided. Meshes can be downloaded from here. WARNING: meshes were created in inches!

1. Calculate the 𝑢ref velocity, reference density (𝜌ref), and kinematic viscosity (𝜈) AT THE LOCATION of the Pitot-static probe and justify the assumption of incompressible and isothermal flow.                                                                                                                                                         HINT: The necessary calculations rely on the ideal gas law and the definition of the stagnation pressure, stagnation temperature and Mach numbers. Thereafter, the inlet flow condition can be estimated based on the simplified continuity equation establishing the product of the cross-sectional area (𝐴) and the bulk velocity (𝑢𝑏) is constant (𝐴⋅𝑢𝑏=constant). The simplified nonlinear governing equations can be solved iteratively (e.g., based on a Matlab script).

2. Calibrate your simulation and determine the simulation parameters needed to match the experimental setup using the very coarse mesh. The whole cohort should agree on the numerical settings which must be kept the same in every simulation. Pay attention to the nondimensional wall distance and discuss which wall function (when needed) would be most appropriate.                                                                                                                                                             HINT: Multiple simulations should be carried out with inlet velocities above and below the estimated 𝑢𝑏 and zero pressure outlet. Based on the simulation results, a curve can be fitted to establish the relationship between the inlet flow condition and the local reference velocity 𝑢ref.
Finally, the necessary inlet condition should be found based on interpolation to match the reference velocity. The outlet pressure should be offset to match 𝑝ref.

3. Carry out the computations and check that flow properties align with the experimental case. Ensure the quality of the simulations by monitoring mass imbalance and reference quantities convergence in addition to residuals. Perform a grid convergence study using at least three grids including the very coarse mesh and assess the spatial resolution of the simulation.

4. Visualise the flow field focusing on the pressure and the velocity field and describe the key flow features including vortical motions. Comment on how the results compare with your expectations based on the literature. The direct numerical study of (S. Pirozzoli, 2018) might serve as a good starting point.

5. Demonstrate that a spatially developing boundary layer is present in the test section with self-similar profiles with increasing streamwise coordinate. Compare the results to the law of the wall (including both the viscous sublayer and the log-law) and to direct numerical simulation data of the flat plate (P. Schlatter, 2010).

6. Investigate how the velocity profile compares with reference data in the symmetry plane of the test section and near the corners and explain your observations based on the computed structure of the Reynolds stress tensor.

7. The variables of interest are listed here. Export and format the data for all grid levels and upload it to this shared folder. The uploaded files must be formatted to match exactly the format of the provided templates and file headers must be modified to show student and simulation details.

8. Consider the test section and carry out calculations to determine the spatial resolution and time step size for a DNS or LES study of your case (as indicated in Table 1). Estimate the memory requirements and computational time needed to perform these simulations. Comment on how simulation parameters should be adjusted if an aerofoil was placed in the test section with relatively high angle of attack. (Running scale-resolved simulations is not required.)

9. Utilise the data of another case where only one parameter is different from your settings and carry out a detailed comparison. Beyond visualisation, quantify the differences, for example, by highlighting the size of the volume where the mean velocities differ by more than 5%, by reporting the locations and values of minimum and maximum differences, etc.
